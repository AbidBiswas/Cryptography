# Cryptography in Web Penetration Testing & Bug Bounty

Cryptography plays a crucial role in web penetration testing and bug bounty hunting. Understanding cryptographic concepts can help identify vulnerabilities in authentication, data protection, and secure communication mechanisms.

## 🔹 Key Areas Where Cryptography is Needed

### 🔑 1. Login Bypass
- Exploiting weak or improperly implemented encryption mechanisms in authentication.
- Identifying misconfigured security controls that allow unauthorized access.

### 🔍 2. Hash Functions
- Understanding weak hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1) used for storing passwords.
- Cracking hashes using rainbow tables or brute-force attacks.

### 🔄 3. Encoding & Decoding for Sensitive Data
- Inspecting API requests and responses to identify API keys, usernames, and other sensitive information.
- Decoding Base64, URL encoding, and other encoding formats.

### 📜 4. JSON Web Token (JWT) Security
- Identifying JWT misconfigurations such as weak secret keys.
- Checking for algorithm manipulation (e.g., changing `alg` to `none`).
- Token signature verification bypass.

### 🏴‍☠️ 5. Post Method Login Cipher Decoding
- Analyzing encrypted credentials in HTTP POST requests.
- Identifying weak encryption schemes that can be reversed.

### 🍪 6. Cookie Tampering & Manipulation
- Modifying encrypted session cookies to escalate privileges.
- Identifying weak encryption methods in session tokens.
- Exploiting poorly protected session identifiers.
